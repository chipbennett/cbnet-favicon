Add a Favicon to your site. No bells or whistles; simply upload a (ICO, PNG, or GIF) file.

== Description ==

Add a Favicon to your site. No bells or whistles; simply upload a (ICO, PNG, or GIF) file.

Note: Plugin settings can be configured via Dashboard -> Settings -> Favicon.

Note 2: I sincerely hope that this Plugin will be made obsolete, through the incorporation of the Favicon feature into core. In the meantime, this 
Plugin allows you to keep your Favicon setting separate from any Theme settings, so that you don't lose your Favicon if you switch Themes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I choose a Favicon? =

Just upload a file of your own. Note that Favicons file type must be one of ICO, PNG, JPEG, or GIF.
